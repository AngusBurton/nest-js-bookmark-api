# NestJS REST API - Bookmark App

REST API to store bookmarks of users built with the NestJS framework. Added simple JWT Authentication and end-to-end tests using JestJS. I also used docker compose to create a postgres database and connect it using prisma2.

I really enjoyed creating the api and now have an understanding of how testing works in a backend application.
